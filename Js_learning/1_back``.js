// const name = 'Ramesh'
// const age = 22
// const weight = 60



// const greet = "Hello " + name + ", ur age is " + age + ", ur weight is" + weight
// console.log(greet)

// // Instead of using above code we can use the following code, using backticks
// const greet1 = `Hello ${name}
// I know you are ${age} years old and
// your weight is ${weight},
// and it should be ${weight - 10}`//so we can perform some basic operations also in this
// console.log(greet1)
